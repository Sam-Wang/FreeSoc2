 "Engineers add data sheets to Sparkle for any new parts found" "Add comments to datasheets for NDA things"  
 "Minimize number of unique components "   
 "Natural bridges vs. polygons for motor driver ICs" "Ok with no natural bridges or polygons on pins, add trestrict between all adjacent pads (ADD to part creation list)"  
 "Double-sided acceptable only with all SMT, no mix " "discuss more"  
 "List of selective-solder non-compatible parts" "add to QC repo"  
 "Test strategy must be established during prototyping stage " "scheduled DFT meeting?"  
 "What layer to label for routing out, board dimensions" route  
 "Standard for LED color selection (red for power, blue for STAT, green for TX, yellow for RX)" YES.  
 "Label for polarity outside of package for visibility after production" YES.  
 "Reference designators for each part on silkscreen on the boards" "more diligent on board files for name values, silk labels only on important hackable parts for user "  
    
"Part Selection List"    
 "No EOL components "   
 "No sole-source components if possible "   
 "Multiple manufacturers specified with minimal part cost difference "   
 "Adhere to stock parts list - minimize deviations (part of scrubbing process w/ outside collaborators)"
